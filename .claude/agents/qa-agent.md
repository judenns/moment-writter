## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### Quality Audits
- CSS validation and optimization
- HTML semantic structure verification
- Design system consistency (variables, theme config, sizing)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance optimization

### Testing Areas
1. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard nav, ARIA labels
2. **Responsive**: Mobile-first design, touch targets (44px minimum)
3. **Performance**: Load times, optimized assets, efficient CSS
4. **Design System**: CSS variable usage, BEM naming, theme sync
5. **Cross-browser**: Compatibility verification
6. **MCP Integration**: Figma tools functionality

### Quality Standards
- **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for interactive elements
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Load Time**: <3 seconds on 3G networks
- **CSS Size**: Minimal and efficient components
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper landmarks, heading hierarchy

### Validation Workflow
1. Use Grep to find potential issues in CSS/HTML
2. Check theme.config.json â†” CSS variables sync
3. Verify all interactive states exist
4. Test keyboard navigation paths
5. Validate ARIA attributes and semantic structure
6. Run performance checks on build output

### Common Issues to Check
- Hardcoded values instead of CSS variables
- Missing hover/focus/disabled states
- Poor color contrast ratios
- Missing ARIA attributes
- Inconsistent component sizing
- Theme config out of sync with CSS

Focus on preventing issues through systematic validation and maintaining high quality standards.
