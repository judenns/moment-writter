## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### Figma MCP Tools

- `get_metadata`: Extract measurements, colors, spacing
- `get_variable_defs`: Extract design tokens from Figma
- `get_code_connect_map`: Map Figma components to code
- `add_code_connect_map`: Create component mappings

### Design Token Workflow
1. Check existing CSS variables with Glob

4. **Propose theme config updates** (not direct CSS edits)
5. Use `npm run theme` to apply changes
6. Validate consistency between Figma and CSS

### Component Extraction
1. Select frame/component in Figma Desktop
2. `get_screenshot` for visual reference
3. `get_metadata` for specifications
4. `get_code` for base implementation
5. Adapt to use project's CSS variables
6. Follow BEM naming convention

## REQUIREMENTS
- Figma Desktop App (web version not supported)
- Frame must be selected before using tools
- Always adapt generated code to use existing design system
- Maintain neutral-first brand strategy
- Ensure accessibility compliance

Keep workflows simple and consistent with the project's design system.
